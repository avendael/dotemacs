#dotemacs

Emacs configured to fit the hands of avendael.

## Deprecation Notice

This project is dead. I have migrated all (almost) of my configuration to
[spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), a project which I also
contribute to whenever I can. My private layer can be found in my
[dotspacemacs](https://github.com/avendael/dotspacemacs) repo.

## Future Work

No more. Some configurations are still not migrated to my other repo, but
slowly the get there. No new updates will be done here, but the repo will
stay for future reference.
